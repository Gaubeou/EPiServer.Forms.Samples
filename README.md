# EPiServer.Forms.Samples
Open source of EPiServer.Forms.Samples package (which is published here http://nuget.episerver.com/en/OtherPages/Package/?packageId=EPiServer.Forms.Samples)

This is not intended to be a starter solution but provides the ability to showcase a number of features that may be needed for developing Forms extensions.
This package contains extra Form Elements, which required more dependency on complex JS libraries.

We will push code here after every release.
